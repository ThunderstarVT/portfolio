            <p>
                I'm a <b>second-year</b> <b>game development</b> <b>student</b>, this page showcases a bunch of games and other projects I've worked on in the past.
                I enjoy programming <b>gameplay systems</b>, <b>tools</b>, <b>mechanics</b>, and similar things.
                Most of my personal projects are driven by ideas I personally care about rather than a specific target audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I take on a task, I will make sure it gets done, and I'm always happy to <b>help others</b> when they're stuck.
                I mainly work with <b>C#</b>, with prior experience in <b>Java</b> (including Minecraft modding), and I've also worked with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, and the <b>Twitch API</b> through some stuff for my vtubing hobby.
                I adapt quickly to new languages as well, recently helping out with <b>Python</b> despite having no prior experience with it.
